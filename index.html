        <p>What are my channels about? My channels, both Twitch and YouTube, are all about having fun and building a safe, welcoming community. This ranges from video games such as PlayerUnknown's BattleGrounds, to motovlogs and videos about cars. Everyone has a place here and I would be happy to see everyone there! I read all comments (due to there not really being many) so make sure to say hello and I will be sure to say hello back!</p>

    <div class="favorite">
      <p>My favorite types of video games are solo or battle royale games. This includes, once again, PUBG, Assassin's Creed, and a few racing games such as Forza and Need for Speed.</p>
